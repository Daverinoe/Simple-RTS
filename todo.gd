# Todo list!

# State machine!

# Common states for all units
# - Idle state
# - Move state
# - Attack state
# - Attack move state? Can I combine states?
# - Hold position state
# - Follow state
# - Stop state (like idle, but don't attack?)
# - Death state
# - Damage state
# - Heal state
# - ALL the states!!!

# Also probably should do some basic movement stuff. Like, navmesh + simple path?
# Simple path isn't good, but it's easy
